This is my first attempt at reconstructing an existing website, started 9/23/19.
I mostly googled solutions to issues as I came across them, and didn't resort to developer tools except for identifying colors (all the CSS is minified and incomprehensible anyway).
As a result of this project I have a better understanding of:
-Creating navbars
-Centering elements horizontally and vertically
-Using CSS with an external style sheet (primarily) and   inline style
-How to grab colors from an existing website using        devtools
-Creating buttons
-Creating search bars
-Using padding and margins to move elements around
